         <h2>About Me</h2>
         <p>I was a young lad when the first Nintendo was released and it was with the help of Mario and Luigi that forever changed my outlook. As technology continued to develop, my interest developed as well. Eventually I took a Cisco Networking class in high school but it wasn't until LAUNCHCODE came along and provided the tools neccessary to quench my thirst for development.</p>
     
         <p>That being said, I cannot learn enough as I continue to learn, grow, and look for multiple places to develop, whether solo or in a team environment (preferably team environment as I continue to learn). I value and embrace everyone with knowledge of this subject matter.</p>
